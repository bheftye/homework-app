Typescript, Express & Node as backend.

Install typescript

Add "tsc": "tsc" to "scripts" to execute from command line

Initialize typescript by calling "npm run tsc"

Uncomment a line outDir and add ./build to store the transpiled TS -> JS

Install dependencies
express, @types/express (this need to be added for TS to understand Express Types)

Create the app directory and add app.ts to it. (main file), build a simple app.

Compile the app with
npm run tsc

A build directory will be created containing the transpiled js.

Test the app by executing with node
node build/app.js

You can cUrl from console to see the functionality.

Running TS while on development

Install ts-node package
npm install ts-node-dev -s

Add two more scripts to package.json
scripts:{
    ...
    "dev": "ts-node-dev --respawn --transpileOnly ./app/app.ts",
    "prod": "tsc && node ./build/app.js"
}

For development we will transpile when a file is changed.
For production we will only use the build of our app.

Run development environment
npm run dev

Run production environment
npm run prod

Configure TypeORM & MySQL

You can install typeORM as global to use a CLI command that will create everything we need
done before.

./route/to/typeorm init --name project-name --database sqlite --express

npm install

Install dependencies if project was already initialized.
npm install -s helmet cors jsonwebtoken bcryptjs class-validator ts-node-dev

Install dependencies to types since we are using TypeScript.
npm install -s @types/bcryptjs @types/body-parser @types/cors @types/helmet @types/jsonwebtoken
